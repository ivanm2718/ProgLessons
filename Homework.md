Do a library vue-only app, similiar to your TasksStart.html code

make each book have properties:
Book = {
    id:
    title:
    author:
    coverUrl:
}

where coverUrl is a book cover image that is displayed on page 
(make each book show a small image and title and author names below)

implement functions for adding new books (for adding image just copy url), deleting and updating(update name only) books

style code with css however you like
